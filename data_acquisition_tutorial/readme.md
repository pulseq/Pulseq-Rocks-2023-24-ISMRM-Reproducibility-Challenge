# Tutorials for Harmonized Data Acquisition Using Pulseq
This directory contains materials and tutorials for data acquisition with vendor-based and Pulseq-based MPRAGE and EPI sequences on Siemens and GE scanners.
## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 Programming Tools
In order to design sequences using *Pusleq* (https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq), Matlab/Python software needs to be installed on your computer. Basic familiarity with Matlab/Python programming is required. It is also possible to program sequences using Pulseq on Google CoLab without installing programming tools on your computer (further information: https://github.com/pulseq/MR-Physics-with-Pulseq).   
### 1.2 Pulseq Softwares
* For Matlab users, please download the Pulseq software from https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq and install Pulseq software in Matlab by adding its directory and subdirectories to Matlab's path.
* For Python users, please install *pyPulseq* (https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq) for your sequence programming.
* For GE users, the TOPPE (https://github.com/toppeMRI/toppe) software is required to convert the *.seq* file to a *.tar* file that can be run on a GE scanner with the TOPPE interpreter.
### 1.3 Text Compare Tool
We recommend using a text comparison tool to compare the sequences within the subsequent steps to visualize the changes that occur at each
step. *Meld* software can be used for text comparison and can be downloaded from <https://meldmerge.org/>. By using Meld or other comparable software packages, it is possible to very quickly make the relevant changes easily visible, as in the example below.

### 1.4 Pulseq interpreters
The Pulseq interpreter can be used to execute the Pulseq sequence file (.seq file) generated by Matlab, PyPulseq, or other tools on a particular MR scanner.
* The interpreter for Siemens scanners can be obtained after signing a Siemens C2P agreement (for more information, please send an inquiry to pulseq.mr-at-uniklinik-freiburg.de).
* The interpreter for GE scanners can be obtained upon request (for more information, please send an inquiry to jfnielse-at-umich.edu).
## 2. MPRAGE Data Acquisition
### Pulseq-based MPRAGE
We develop a 3D MPRAGE sequence with GRAPPA acceleration and noise scan using
